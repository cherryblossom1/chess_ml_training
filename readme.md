# Chess Music Generator

This project aims to generate music based on chess games. By combining the moves played in a chess game with musical elements, we can create unique and harmonious compositions. The goal is to develop a machine learning-based approach to generate musical patterns that correlate with the chess moves.

## Roadmap

1. Data Collection:
   - Explore the Lichess API or available datasets to gather a large collection of chess games. This will serve as the training data for the ML model.
   - Design a function or script that can efficiently retrieve game data from Lichess and store it locally.

2. PGN Parsing:
   - Extend the existing PGN parsing capabilities to handle the large dataset collected. Ensure the parsing process is optimized for efficiency to handle a high volume of games.

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Determine the relevant features for training the ML model. These could include move types, piece positions, game outcomes, and any additional features that may influence the musical composition.
   - Design a mapping mechanism that assigns musical attributes (such as frequencies or notes) to the extracted features. This mapping will be used during training and music generation.

4. Model Training:
   - Select an appropriate ML algorithm for the task, such as a neural network or decision tree-based model.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Train the model using the training set and fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize its performance.
   - Validate the model using the testing set and measure its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

5. Music Generation:
   - Once the model is trained, use it to generate music for new chess moves.
   - Given a chess move as input, pass it through the model to predict the corresponding musical attributes.
   - Use the mapping mechanism to convert the predicted attributes into actual musical notes or patterns.

6. Training and Testing Iterations:
   - Continuously iterate on the model training process, adjusting hyperparameters, and incorporating user feedback to improve the quality of music generation.
   - Explore different ML architectures and techniques to enhance the model's performance.
   - Regularly test the model on new chess games and evaluate its ability to generate pleasing and coherent musical compositions.

## Getting Started

To start this project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the project environment and install the required dependencies.
2. Begin with Step 1 of the roadmap: Data Collection.
3. Proceed through each step, implementing the necessary components and refining the model as you progress.

Feel free to adapt the roadmap to suit your specific needs and experiment with different approaches along the way.
